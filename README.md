# Project Portfolio 1 - HTML and CSS Essentials

## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS languages.  I am creating a website for the Mattie McDonagh Community Centre campus in Ballygar, County Galway, Ireland.  My hope would be that this would eventually serve as the framework to create a genuine website in the future.  My intention is to showcase everything the facility has to offer with a clean design, accessibility and easy-to- navigate pages which includes all the required learning outcomes.

## Brief

The Mattie McDonagh Centre, (henceforth known as "the Centre") is managed by the Ballygar & Districts Co Ltd committee which is entirely made up of volunteers

The committee wants this website:
<ol>
<li>To showcase and promote the Centre as a venue both within the local community and to also reach a wider audience</li>
<li>To increase membership</li>
<li>To provide up-to-date information to users and the broader community</li>
