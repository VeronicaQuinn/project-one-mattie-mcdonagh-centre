# Project Portfolio 1 - HTML and CSS Essentials

## Project Objectives
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate competency in HTML and CSS languages.  I am creating a website for the Mattie McDonagh Community Centre campus in Ballygar, County Galway, Ireland.  My hope would be that this would eventually serve as the framework to create a genuine website in the future.  My intention is to showcase everything the facility has to offer with a clean design, accessibility and easy-to- navigate pages which includes all the required learning outcomes.

## UX Planes

### Strategy Plane
### Brief

The Mattie McDonagh Centre, (henceforth known as "the Centre") is managed by the Ballygar & Districts Co Ltd committee which is entirely made up of volunteers

The committee wants this website:
<ol>
<li>To showcase and promote the Centre as a venue both within the local community and to also reach a wider audience</li>
<li>To increase membership</li>
<li>To provide up-to-date information to users and the broader community</li>
</ol>

### Scope Plane

<p>The four pages of the website will be designed with a view to meeting each of the three main aims individually but with a cohesive flow between them</p>
<ul>
<li>The <u>HOME</u> page will give a brief history of the Mattie McDonagh Centre and a description of its place in the community.  It will contain links to the other pages within the website, external links for email, phone and an embedded google map</li>
<li>The <u>SCHEDULE</u> page will contain a table featuring the sports hall schedule</li>
<li>The <u>FACILITIES</u> page will include numerous images of everything that the Centre has to offer</li>
<li>The <u>BECOME A MEMBER!</u> page will contain a membership form which will include different input types, radio buttons, a checkbox and submit with a number of required inputs</li>
