        <p>Mattie McDonagh Centre was established in 2001 by the Ballygar Community Development
            Group. The group were responsible for the co-ordination of the planning process for the Centre.
            Along with the Centre the Niall Walsh Pitch was also developed.
            The location of the Centre was ideal as it provided ample parking for events. It is situated away from
            passing traffic which is ideal as many users are young. The Mattie McDonagh Centre is the heart and
            soul of the community providing much needed space and facilities required.
            The Centre assists in the physical and social development of all members of the community. It
            increases the level of participation from both children and adults.
            The Centre has many uses which add to the town. St Marys College use the indoor hall for PE. It
            enables the students to participate in PE all year round as they have no indoor facility in the school
            suitable for it. The Centre plays a role in developing and enhancing the sporting skills of the
            students.
            The school also used the facilities for graduation ceremonies, drama, exams and workshops. They
            also have access to the gym. The local National Schools also make use of the facilities. The local
            Montessori and Playschool also use the Centre for different activities during the year.
            Because the Centre has many rooms it means different activities can be on-going at the same time.
            The local clubs make great use of the facility as it means they can continue with training during
            inclement weather. It also provides dressing rooms for the players for before and after games. The
            local clubs can host games knowing they have a state-of-the-art facility available. They can also offer
            refreshments from the kitchen after games. Refereeâ€™s also have access to changing facilities away
            from the teams.
            Badminton and handball are played here weekly also. A new floor was laid last year and has all the
            lines relevant to all indoor sports.</p>
