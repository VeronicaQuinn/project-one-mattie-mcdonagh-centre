    <section class="about">
        <p>The Mattie McDonagh Community Centre is at the heart and soul of the community. The campus is an incredible
            example of what a small community can accomplish and is the envy of visitors from other localities. Named
            after local Gaelic Football sensation Mattie McDonagh, the only player from Connacht to hold four
            All-Ireland medals, it brings together every single aspects of community life imaginable. It is a testament
            to those who oversaw its construction and to the entire parish of Ballygar-Tohergar-Newbridge who continue
            to maintain it
        </p>

        <h2 class="page-headings">About</h2>
        <p>The Mattie McDonagh Centre opened its doors in 2001 and is located in the east-Galway town of Ballygar. The
            construction of the building and development of the adjacent Niall Walsh Community Field was overseen by the
            exclusively volunteer-run Ballygar Community Development Group and was largely financed by local
            fundraising, grants and volunteer labour. The Centre is now run by Ballygar & Districts Co Ltd which is
            still entirely made up of community volunteers
        </p>
        <p>The location of the Centre is ideal as it provided ample parking for events and is safely tucked away from
            passing traffic. Both the building and sports field are easily accessible to all abilities and ages and the
            scheduled activities are numerous and varied with a view to inclusivity.
