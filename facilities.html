                <p>The <strong>Main Hall</strong> in the Mattie McDonagh Centre is a massive space that can accomodate
                    any and all sporting, cultural and community events.
                    It contains full-sized regulation futsal, volleyball and basketball courts as well as two smaller
                    basketball
                    courts with six basketball hoops in total.
                    There are also four regulation badminton courts and three courts for handball. The top quality
                    hardwood floor was
                    refinished earlier this year with new lines painted for all the sports mentioned above. The local
                    primary and secondary
                    schools all use the hall for PE and the local clubs make up a packed schedule in the evenings and
                    weekends of indoor
                    training and competitions throughout the entire year. Since it opened its doors in 2001
                    the Centre has regularly hosted County, Provicial and National sporting events at every age level

                        events including drama productions
                        fundraisers, awards ceremonies, concerts, craft shows and Enterprise Town events, meetings,

                        the list is
                        endless. And last but most definitely not least, it is the main venue for the annual Ballygar

                        Ireland

                    <p>The <strong>Niall Walsh Community Field</strong> is owned by the community for the community.
                        Anyone
                        and everyone can use the field for any sport they like. It's managed by the manager of the
                        Mattie McDonagh Centre
                        and is in comstant use by the clubs and schools, and sometimes by just a group of young people
                        who want to meet up and
                        'poc around'. It is a beautiful setting, well-maintained, and is safely nestled in a quiet
                        location away from local traffic.
                        The design of the campus means that the Mattie McDonagh Centre is easily accessed directly from
                        the pitch. The pitch is exclusively for
                        under-18s and is an ideal size with portable and fixed goals all there to cater to every stage
                        from 2-18 years (and even younger...?)
